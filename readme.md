# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model

The goal for this project is to build a model for detecting hate speech in tweets. In other words a binary classifaciton task, (hate speech) or (not hate speech). This repository implements and compares 4 different models for this task: BoW (bag of words), LSTM (long term short term memory network), SVM (suppor vector) & MnB (multinomial bayes).

## Getting Started
Notebook 1 contains data preprocessing and the BoW model.
Notebook 2 contains the LSTM, SVM & MnB and analysis/comparison of results.
